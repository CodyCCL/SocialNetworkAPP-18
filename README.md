# SocialNetworkAPP built with NoSQL-18
## Description
```
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. I have to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
